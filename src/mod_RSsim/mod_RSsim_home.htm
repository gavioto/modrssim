<h3>Purpose & features</h3>

<p>This simulator was written to allow the testing of a MODBUS RTU serial driver
without having to get 255 little MODBUS PLCs into one office. It is not, by any
means, a full implementation of the protocol; it implements only the common functions
used in MODBUS.</p>

<p>It surpasses the limitations in other programs we have found in the
past by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simulate more than one RTU at once. (register values shared for all RTUs).</li>
  <li>Allows editing and display of all the registers.</li>
  <li>Allow scanning of registers not actually in the display.</li>
  <li>Running on &gt;1 comm ports (You have to run two copies of the program.). You need to run the
    first copy; then, when you run it again, it defaults to use the next free RS-232 port.
    All copies will use the same settings though.</li>
  <li>A way of disabling just certain stations. (Just click on the boxes at the bottom.)</li>
  <li>Load and save values you type into each register (the file is saved in the same folder) as well
	as simulate changes in the values. Hotkey &lt;CTRL&gt;-L =Load and &lt;CTRL&gt;-A for sAve.</li>
  <li>You can specify the PDU length (Protocol Data Unit) to simulate RTU's with different internal
telegram buffer sizes. Hotkey &lt;CTRL&gt;-M</li>
  <li>Display values in different formats hex/dec etc.</li>
  <li>Specify responsiveness of the simulator to simulate slow hardware. Hotkey &lt;CTRL&gt;-S .</li>
  <li>Simulate certain types of comms errors that would be hard to do in a &quot;lab&quot;
situation.</li>
  <li>A basic comms debugger showing request/response. Hotkey : &lt;CTRL&gt;-C.</li>
  <li>Emulation to simulate MOSCAD RTU on modbus. Hotkey &lt;CTRL&gt;-S or &lt;CTRL&gt;-M . </li>
  <li>Simulate noisy comms lines. Hotkey &lt;CTRL&gt;-N. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Not supported</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ASCII protocol support.</li>
  <li>This application is not intended as a full implementation of MODBUS, it is not commercially supported
    and no liability is held for any damage or application changes made as a result of it's use.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Running this program</h3>
<p>This is not a full feature list, just the basics, which most will get in 5 minutes anyway.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Launch the app, &quot;mod_rssim.exe&quot; and it should open the 1st free RS-232 port,
    click on the <b>Port Settings..."</b> button to change any settings. Settings are saved
    to Windows<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> registry.
  <li>Hook up a cable (just a 2,3 and 7 crossed ,4,5 looped, and 6,8,20 looped should be fine,
    hardware handshaking is not my strong side), but there is some support there.</li>
  <li>The boxes at the bottom work like indicators to show which stations are active; the gray
    outline of each box will change color (they turn off after five seconds), and clicking them
    disables each station (only 60 are shown). The green background turns red to show a disabled
    station. Disabled stations will still show activity, but the sim. will just not respond back.</li>
  <li>Double-click on the list-view over a register, to edit it's value, double-clicking on
    digital I/O just toggle them.</li>
  <li>Switch between the Hex and Decimal views. (adddresses also come in hex, this is beta.)</li>

  <BR><b><i>Some advanced options:</b></i>
  <li>New option for starting with all devices offline added.</li>
  <li><b>Load</b> will not work unless you have saved first.</li>
  <li><b>Save</b> will save all the register values to a flat binary file (don't edit it, I can't)
    called 'modbus.dat', in the current folder. This is nice to allow you to fill the registers with
    values, and then come back latter to the same setup.</li>
  <li>Click on <b>Animation Settings...</b> to change the color of the indicators at the bottom,
    and set up some simulation data.</li>
  <li><b>Zero values</b> will clear all values (also the digitals become 0).</li>
  <li>The &quot;responsiveness&quot; setting changes the delay in the program before it responds to a valid request.</li>
  <li>Report any problems after trying for at least a day to figure out what U got wrong :-)</li>
</ul>

<a name=More><h3>FAQ /More</h3></a>

<ul>
  <li><b>Q:&nbsp;</b>What is a MODBUS RTU? <BR><b>A:</b>&nbsp;It's a PLC, if that does not
    make sense, visit www.modicon.com.</li>
  <li>Some features are not documented at this time, look around.</li>
  <li>There is however one variation on the MODBUS documentation, for function force single coil 0x05 -the simulator
    responds with the value before modifying the actual coil, not after modifying the coil. This was wrong, but
    was easiest to implement, and there is now a setting for this. (See Emulation settings - Hotkey &lt;CTRL&gt;-M)</li>
  <li>We also have an Ethernet TCP/IP version of this program (it is an earlier and less fancy version).</li>
